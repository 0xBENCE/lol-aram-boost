# Update

### Riot Games has cracked down on numerous community-made scripts as of recently (February 23, 2021), and extra security measures were introduced. The endpoint that lol-aram-boost depended on has been completely deprecated and made unusable for its original purpose. The repository itself will stay up, although in an archived state, as I believe regardless of its usability, it can still be salvaged and be used to learn the basics of the League of Legends Client API. 

# lol-aram-boost

Skin boosts a League of Legends ARAM lobby without consuming any RP, temporarily unlocking you a skin and granting extra BE at the end of your match

# Usage

1. Get into an ARAM champion select lobby
2. Run the script
3. Your lobby should now be skin boosted!
